    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Given a farely great amount of data about bulldozers (features and their sales price), is it possible to predict the sale - price of a bulldozer using a linear - regression machine learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "###### The data used in this project comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The data was part of a [kaggle - competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview) which aim was to find a suitable model to predict the prices of bulldozers.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The data is split into three different sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Train.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "* is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "  Valid.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Valid.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "* is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012. You make predictions on this set.\n",
    "  Test.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Test.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "* is the test set. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012.\n",
    "  Evaluation\n",
    "  The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted         auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> [source](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Features\n",
    "There are 52 different features in the data sets. Those are described in detail in the data-dictionary in this project. For more information about the features check: [Features](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)"
